Welcome to your new Octopress blog.

All the source has been stored in a new Github repository. Whenever you push to Github, Netlify will fetch the changes and run an Octopress build.

To work with the blog locally:

1. Clone the github repository
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Add blog posts: `rake new_post["post title"]
4. Watch for changes: `rake watch`
5. Run a preview server: `rake preview` and visit localhost:4000
6. Commit and push to Github to deploy

Enjoy!
